# **Project Name**:

25.6b API Route Requests with Swagger

# **Description**:

The purpose of this exercise is to get used to implementing GET, POST, DELETE and PATCH requests in an API with Swagger. Swagger is a tool to help a developer auto-generate documentation on how one can use the API created and shared in an open-source environment. As of November of 2023 I am a novice developer and still getting used to implementing route requests.

This exercise highlights my capabilities in Javascript, React, Node.js, npm, Express, API's, route reqests, and my first taste of Swagger. This exercise demonstrates my beginning skills in employing API requests with Swagger, and demonstrates my initial steps into back end development. I worked on this particular exercise in Novemeber of 2023, during module 25 (after 25.6) from the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."

# **Dependencies**: 

The exercise relies on the following dependencies: HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Nodemon, npm, Express, and Swagger. Note: the versions are outdated.

# **Usage**:

To run my project on your machine, download the files onto your machine or clone the repo. 

* Run npm install. 
* Type terminal command: nodemon index.js
* In a browser window, navigate to http://localhost:5000/api-docs/, where the Swagger interface will be displayed.
* The exercise was to "write the requests" and then verify they worked on the Swagger interface.

# **Support**: 

Please contact me via email at krentmeester@uwalumni.com.

# **Roadmap**: 

I likely future improvement to this as a "project" would be:
* Add more complexity to the "movies". Currently, there is just a title. I could add genre, director, awards, top actors, etc. to each Movie title.
* The "chosen" movies could be the top 20 (or another number) based on votes from the website visitor
* I will note that despite using reference material from the MIT bootcamp courework to create this exercise, I did find another resource that leads me to suspect all the routes written in index.js are duplicate, unnecessary, and could possibly cause interference when running the Express app. Since the index.js file typically serves as an entry point, the app.js file should contain the logic. Having these two files separated is better organized and more concise coding practice. I would like to circle back and see if I can "reduce" the duplicated code and maintain an app that is functional. This difference in code writing may be due to employing outdated code from MIT that is not in alignment with the updated ES6 features. I need some time to figure this out.
